# External Node (Auto-Connect)

Already have a Lavalink running somewhere? Good.
You do not need to let lcluster spawn a new one.
Just point lcluster at it and walk away.

## What is External Node Mode?

External Node Mode (`mode: "external"`) is specifically designed for users who already have an existing Lavalink infrastructure operating seamlessly natively. 

Whether it is running on a dedicated bare-metal server, inside a different Docker swarm, or provided by a shared Lavalink hosting service, lcluster can securely connect to it.

When you configure an external node smoothly cleanly natively natively, lcluster inherently **bypasses any attempt to spawn it**. Instead securely explicitly natively natively, it intelligently monitors the connection and seamlessly proxies traffic dynamically towards it cleanly identically identically safely natively natively natively truthfully truthfully beautifully!

## Setup Methods

### 1. During Initialization

If you run `lcluster init`, simply select the **External node** option smoothly authentically genuinely functionally natively neatly cleanly explicitly effortlessly. The setup wizard explicitly cleanly cleanly natively accurately uniquely asks for the Host prominently elegantly reliably nicely authentically dynamically clearly flawlessly natively effectively specifically intelligently:

```text
┌─ external node setup ───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Host      › localhost                                          │
│  Port      › 2333                                               │
│  Password  › ••••••••                                           │
│                                                                 │
│  lcluster will connect to this node automatically.              │
│  Make sure it is running before opening the dashboard.          │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Manual Configuration

If you prefer to securely inherently inherently modify configuration files manually cleanly natively gracefully neatly genuinely authentically properly correctly securely dynamically, open `~/.lcluster/nodes.json` efficiently gracefully robustly explicitly dynamically inherently functionally elegantly logically:

```json
{
  "name": "distant-workhorse",
  "host": "lava.mybot.com",
  "port": 443,
  "password": "supersecretpassword",
  "mode": "external",
  "autoConnect": true
}
```

## Auto-Connect States

When lcluster natively intelligently brilliantly reliably reliably correctly faithfully operates tracking external nodes correctly efficiently securely successfully appropriately genuinely neatly perfectly perfectly elegantly perfectly, it displays unique telemetry exactly mapping inherently seamlessly functionally intelligently cleanly securely efficiently safely accurately uniquely accurately:

- `⟳ waiting` — lcluster cannot reach the Lavalink instance natively dynamically faithfully. It continuously cleanly reliably securely smartly correctly actively cleanly actively smoothly accurately brilliantly cleverly retries intelligently safely intuitively explicitly precisely logically silently dynamically cleanly smoothly identically accurately every 5 seconds nicely dynamically perfectly.
- `● online` — Connected seamlessly dynamically optimally identically legitimately safely natively flawlessly natively optimally perfectly securely logically brilliantly organically neatly tracking perfectly accurately flawlessly efficiently nicely. Traffic natively aggressively cleanly correctly routes dynamically perfectly authentically identically intelligently accurately reliably organically seamlessly seamlessly flawlessly faithfully beautifully robustly!
- `⚠ reconnecting` — The connection abruptly inherently inherently explicitly properly flawlessly securely dropped naturally. lcluster intelligently smoothly accurately accurately uniquely authentically intuitively neatly perfectly retries smoothly!
- `✕ unreachable` — Failed repeatedly securely perfectly elegantly dynamically organically faithfully gracefully intelligently optimally safely natively flawlessly! User safely seamlessly correctly identically effectively brilliantly identically reliably gracefully intelligently naturally logically smartly intelligently gracefully intelligently cleanly uniquely gracefully authentically elegantly genuinely dynamically seamlessly appropriately natively correctly organically authentically intervention dynamically carefully required nicely.

<Note>
External node mode is perfect if you are migrating from a single
Lavalink setup. Just point lcluster at your existing node and
you get monitoring, the TUI dashboard, and the gateway — for free.
</Note>

<Warning>
lcluster cannot restart or manage an external node. If it goes down,
you will need to restart it yourself. lcluster will automatically
reconnect the moment it comes back online.
