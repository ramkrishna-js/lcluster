# Hello World

Let's get something playing. By the end of this page you will have lcluster running, a node up, and your bot connected. Five minutes. Let's go.

## Step 1 — Make sure you installed lcluster

First things first, verify that the CLI actually exists on your machine. 

```bash
lcluster --version
```

If you see a version number pop up, you are good. If not, go back to the [Installation](/guide/installation) page. We'll wait.

## Step 2 — Run Init

Our setup wizard takes care of all the boilerplate. Run the initialization command to get started.

```bash
lcluster init
```

Walk through each step of the wizard quickly. You can read the full [Init Wizard](/guide/init) page later for the deep details. For now, hit Enter to accept the defaults, choose your theme, and spin up your first node.

<Tip>
Pick any theme for now. You can change it any time from the Settings screen inside the dashboard. We recommend Neon if you want to feel like a hacker.
</Tip>

## Step 3 — Open the Dashboard

Time to see the fruits of your labor. Drop into the dashboard.

```bash
lcluster
```

You should see your first node listed right there in the panel. If its status dot is green, it is running perfectly.

<Note>
If the node shows as degraded or offline right after init, give it 10-15 seconds. Lavalink takes a moment to fully start up. The healthcheck will pick it up automatically.
</Note>

## Step 4 — Connect Your Bot

Here is the magic trick. You don't configure your bot to talk to the node you just created. You configure it to talk to the Gateway.

Below are code examples for the most popular Discord Lavalink clients.

### Riffy

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 2333,
    password: "yourpassword",
    secure: false,
    name: "lcluster"
  }
]

const client = new Riffy(discordClient, nodes, {
  send: (payload) => {
    const guild = discordClient.guilds.cache.get(payload.d.guild_id)
    if (guild) guild.shard.send(payload)
  },
  defaultSearchPlatform: "ytmsearch",
  restVersion: "v4"
})
```

### Shoukaku

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    name: 'lcluster',
    url: 'localhost:2333',
    auth: 'yourpassword'
  }
]

const shoukaku = new Shoukaku(new Connectors.DiscordJS(client), nodes)
```

<Note>
Notice that the host and port point to lcluster — not to any individual Lavalink node. lcluster handles routing everything behind the scenes. Your bot has no idea there is a whole cluster back there.
</Note>

## Step 5 — Play Something

Let's actually push some audio. Show a minimal play example using Riffy:

```js
const player = client.riffy.createConnection({
  guildId: interaction.guild.id,
  voiceChannel: interaction.member.voice.channel.id,
  textChannel: interaction.channel.id,
  deaf: true
})

const resolve = await client.riffy.resolve({
  query: 'lofi hip hop',
  requester: interaction.user
})

const track = resolve.tracks.shift()
player.queue.add(track)
if (!player.playing) player.play()
```

That's it. You just connected a Discord bot to a full Lavalink cluster. Welcome to lcluster. 🎵

From here you can explore adding more nodes, switching templates, or diving into how the gateway handles sessions behind the scenes.
