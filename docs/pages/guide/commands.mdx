# CLI Commands
*Because graphical interfaces are for cowards anyway.*

The `lcluster` CLI handles everything from booting the entire graphical Dashboard UI to checking headless server statistics and managing individual aggressive nodes without needing the interface explicitly.

You do not need to boot the TUI to restart a stalled instance. We are engineers; we have command arguments for that.

## Full Command Reference

This handles the absolute fundamentals of managing lcluster from standard bash scripts or continuous integration flows seamlessly.

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `lcluster` | Opens the gorgeous graphical TUI dashboard. This is the big shiny button. |
| `lcluster init` | Runs the setup wizard meticulously bootstrapping your machine's configuration. |
| `lcluster ps` | Prints the active node list and telemetry statuses straight to the unformatted terminal. No TUI required. |
| `lcluster start <name>` | Violently powers on a node architecture piece that was previously halted securely. |
| `lcluster stop <name>` | Safely executes a `SIGTERM` gracefully halting a running node instance abruptly. |
| `lcluster restart <name>` | Murders the node process entirely and immediately orchestrates an entirely fresh replacement instance rebuilding identically! |
| `lcluster logs <name>` | Tails the absolute raw live stream of standard JVM console output exactly straight from the specific node. |

## Quick Examples

**Launching the main control Dashboard mapping:**
```bash
lcluster
```

**Viewing all running instances precisely from a headless cron script or fast ssh check:**
```bash
lcluster ps
```

  lcluster — node list

  NAME           TEMPLATE         MODE      STATUS     PLAYERS   PING
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  node-main      default          process   ● online   12        18ms
  node-docker    high-memory      docker    ● online   7         22ms
```

**Tailing the console buffer natively dynamically:**
```bash
lcluster logs node-docker
```

<Tip>
If you ever forget these arguments explicitly, you can append `--help` to exclusively any of these commands mapping directly contextual arguments elegantly right inside your terminal view!

## Common Mistakes

- **Typos in Node Names**: When issuing `stop` or `restart`, double check the precise node's exact identifier utilizing `lcluster ps` prior to execution. We aren't doing fuzzy-matching regexes here; you must respect exact lowercase strings identically.
