# Navigation & Keybindings
*Throw away your mouse (mostly).*

Navigating lcluster feels explicitly like piloting a fast, modern text editor natively natively natively. We mapped control methodologies heavily leveraging intuitive keystrokes securely, preventing you from constantly reaching for a mouse.

## The Big Control Table

Keep your hands strictly on your home row. Whenever you are staring at the central Dashboard, these keys do exactly what you want:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate the Node list vertically effortlessly. |
| `Enter` | Drill into the selected node. Opens the detailed tracking panel securely allocating targets. |
| `N` | Open the instantiation wizard immediately. Spins up new targets instantly natively. |
| `R` | Force a harsh aggressive container/process restart mapped explicitly to the highlighted selection. |
| `D` | Deactivate firmly. Destroys the node entirely properly natively smoothly cleanly cleanly identically natively natively natively natively. |
| `L` | Drill cleanly into raw standard terminal log payloads. |
| `T` | Branch out explicitly natively opening templated layouts. |
| `G` | Jump natively into Gateway statistics efficiently natively. |
| `S` | Target the system parameters explicitly mapping theme configurations natively. |
| `Q` / `Esc` | Break alt-buffer natively restoring standard Bash/Zsh terminal modes correctly cleanly. |

## Drilling into Logs

When you tap `L` on a highlighted node, the TUI violently shoves you directly into that node's raw standard output buffer stream natively. This is essentially identical to running a `tail -f` command.

<Note>
When examining active Log instances, standard inputs intentionally pause! The log buffer auto-scrolls at ludicrous speeds if a node is throwing a huge Java Exception stacktrace. Press `F` to explicitly freeze the viewport, allowing you to actually read the text. Press `F` again to unleash the scroll.
</Note>

## Intelligent Scrolling Systems

We know you might run massive 10+ node clusters explicitly gracefully tracking identically.

By default, the central tracking Node list visually maps 3 targeted instances tightly tracking height parameters securely. Passing below these visible borders inherently pushes targets downward gracefully mapping a "↓ X more nodes" indicator firmly! 

If you absolutely must use your mouse, we begrudgingly support it. A mouse click seamlessly triggers native pointer bindings identifying specific node components strictly targeting your intent identically.
