# TUI Overview
*Because managing backend infrastructure should actually look amazing.*

Running complicated distributed stateful services usually involves staring at a dull monochrome log file violently scrolling past errors you can barely read.

We decided to fix that. 

The dashboard fundamentally inside lcluster is built beautifully upon [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) utilizing React component structures explicitly rendering dynamic visuals natively inside standard POSIX terminal alt-buffers! It feels like a native desktop application, but entirely isolated dynamically within your SSH session perfectly!

## The Rendering Paradigm

Invoking the `lcluster` command initiates the TUI strictly mapping to your active active console dimensions smartly.

Because it utilizes an **alt-buffer** architecture cleanly, it fundamentally operates without polluting or spamming your beloved shell history files securely! Furthermore:

- Mouse clicking support translates accurately against physical visual node structures flawlessly tracking layouts seamlessly.
- It leverages targeted graphical isolated rendering mapping directly virtual-DOM React methodologies. 

Unlike aging python curses dashboards mapping brutal massive redraw loops, *only* the specific updated components (like a ping ticking up by 2ms) will redraw securely! This achieves an incredibly lightweight flicker-free cinematic telemetry experience directly mapped inside your terminal naturally!

## Screen Architectures

The lcluster graphical environment isolates operations explicitly mapping five entirely distinct navigation pages actively:

### 1. The Central Dashboard
This is home. It surveys all recorded instances detailing exactly the topology of your architecture securely.

### 2. Node Detail Target Panel
An interactive explicitly contextual graphical right-side panel explicitly extracting individual underlying telemetry dynamically isolating JVM allocations cleanly.

### 3. Templates Explorer
A strictly full-page navigation layout intelligently targeting your `.yml` deployment architectures allowing you explicitly modify behaviors securely natively!

### 4. Direct Logs Trailer
A cleanly visually formatted real-time robust 200-line array ring buffer. It accurately securely plumbs standard instance outputs beautifully formatted explicitly.

### 5. Settings Modal
Your configuration target natively altering explicitly aggressive styling parameters or explicitly rewriting underlying proxy credentials cleanly!

<Tip>
Because lcluster dynamically executes heavily mapped JSX rendering architectures cleanly integrated entirely inside Node.js, parsing these modules requires definitively zero external manual build steps heavily!
